Configuration:
- model: NEMO based on v4.0.4
- global configuration eORCA025 (1/4 degree resolution, ie ~ 10km at 60 S) see Mathiot et al. 2017 for details.
- 121 z vertical levels with a resolution of 1m in surface, ~20m between 100m and 1000m depth and ~250m at 5000m depth.
- bedmachine bathy on shelf
- JRA55 atmospheric forcing
- see https://pmathiot.github.io/NEMOCFG/docs/build/html/simu_eORCA025.html for complete description


Reference = eORCA025.L121-OPM021

eORCA025.L121-OPM020:
   - colder west Antarctica shelf (wrt reference)
   - warm west Ross shelf (wrt reference)

Changes between simulations:

eORCA025.L121-OPM021:
   Oce:
   - isopycnal diffusion: 150 m2/s2
   - eddy induced diffusion: 150 m2/s2
   - no AABW restoring
   - Iceberg distribution follow the Stern et al. (2016) COMPOSITE distribution

   Ice:
   - ice-ocean drag: 5e-3
   - thermal snow conductivity: 0.35 W/m/K
   - no frazil ice
   - no adaptative EVP rheology
   => comments: it helps a lot to produce saltier HSSW

   Simulation:
   - start in 1979
   - cycle back to 1979 after end of 2018.


eORCA025.L121-OPM020 (change wrt to eORCA025.L121-OPM021):
   Oce:
   - Iceberg distribution follow the Marsh et al. (2015)

   Ice:
   - ice-ocean drag: 1e-2
   - thermal snow conductivity: 0.31 W/m/K
   - frazil ice
   - adaptative EVP rheology
